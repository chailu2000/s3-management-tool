A standalone VS Code extension for managing AWS S3 buckets and objects directly from your IDE. No backend required — communicates directly with AWS S3 using the AWS SDK.

## Screenshots

### Main Tree View
Browse S3 buckets and objects in a hierarchical tree view with inline actions.

## Key Features

- **Bucket Management** — Add by name, ARN, or prefix scope
- **Drag & Drop** — Drag local files into buckets/folders to upload
- **Recursive Operations** — Upload/download/rename/delete entire folder trees
- **Multi-Select** — Ctrl+Click to select multiple items, then batch delete or download
- **Sync** — Local ↔ S3 incremental and bidirectional sync with profiles
- **Watch Mode** — Auto-upload local file changes to S3 in real-time
- **Versioning** — List, restore, and delete object versions
- **Tag Management** — View and edit S3 object tags
- **Rename** — Rename files and folders (copy + delete under the hood)
- **Prefix-Level Access** — Works in shared buckets with restricted prefixes

## Context Menu & Multi-Select Behavior

### How Multi-Select Works

| Action | Single Item Selected | Multiple Items Selected |
|--------|---------------------|------------------------|
| **Delete** (inline button) | Deletes the clicked item | Deletes **all** selected items |
| **Download Selected** (inline button) | Downloads the clicked item | Downloads **all** selected items |
| Preview, Rename, Copy, Metadata, Tags, etc. (context menu) | Operates on the clicked item | Operates **only on the right-clicked item** (other selections are ignored) |

> **Important:** When multiple items are selected and you right-click to open the context menu, actions like **Preview**, **Rename**, **Copy Object**, **View Metadata**, **View Versions**, **Manage Tags**, **Copy S3 URI**, and **Generate Presigned URL** will **only operate on the item you right-clicked** — not all selected items. This is a VS Code platform limitation: the extension does not receive the list of selected items for most context menu commands.
>
> **For batch operations**, use the inline buttons:
> - 🗑️ **Delete** — batch deletes all selected items
> - ⬇️ **Download Selected** — batch downloads all selected items

### Context Menu

**Files (right-click):**
- Preview · Rename · Download · Copy Object · View Metadata · Copy S3 URI · Presigned URL · View Versions · Manage Tags

**Folders (right-click):**
- Create Folder · Download Folder · Upload · Copy S3 URI · Rename

**Inline buttons (files & folders):**
- 🗑️ **Delete** — batch-deletes all selected items
- ⬇️ **Download Selected** — batch-downloads all selected items

## Large Folders & Preview Behavior

### Browsing Large Folders

When opening a folder (prefix) in S3, the extension loads objects in pages to maintain performance:

- **Initial Load:** Up to **10,000 items** are loaded immediately
- **Load More:** If the folder contains more than 10,000 items, a **"Load more files…"** button appears at the bottom of the list
  - Shows how many items have been loaded so far (e.g., "10 KB loaded so far")
  - Click to load the next batch of up to 10,000 items
  - Previously loaded items are preserved — new items are appended
  - Repeat until all items are loaded
- **Reset:** Collapsing and re-expanding the folder resets the pagination and starts fresh

This prevents the extension from hanging or becoming unresponsive when browsing folders with hundreds of thousands of files.

> **Note:** S3's `ListObjectsV2` API returns a maximum of 1,000 objects per request. The extension automatically paginates through these requests until it reaches the 10,000 item limit or exhausts all objects.

### Previewing Object Content

The **Preview Content** command opens text-based files directly in VS Code:

**Supported Formats:**
- **Text files:** `.txt`, `.log`, `.md`, `.csv`, `.ini`, `.cfg`, `.conf`, `.properties`, `.env`, `.plist`
- **Code:** `.js`, `.ts`, `.jsx`, `.tsx`, `.py`, `.sh`, `.bash`, `.zsh`, `.sql`
- **Markup:** `.html`, `.xml`, `.yaml`, `.yml`, `.toml`, `.svg`, `.graphql`, `.proto`, `.tf`, `.hcl`
- **MIME Types:** Any file with a `text/*` MIME type is also supported

**Size Limits:**
- **≤ 50 KB:** Full content loaded with a simple header comment
- **50 KB – 5 MB:** Full content loaded with a header showing the file size
- **> 50 KB (truncated):** If a file exceeds 50 KB during streaming, the preview shows the first 50 KB with a clear warning header:
  ```
  // ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════
  // S3 Preview: s3://bucket/path/to/file.json
  // File size: 250 KB — SHOWING FIRST 50 KB ONLY
  // ⚠ This file is larger than 50 KB and has been truncated.
  // ⚠ Download the file to view and edit the full content.
  // ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════
  ```
- **> 5 MB:** Preview is blocked — a message prompts you to download the file instead

**Read-Only:** All previews open in read-only mode. Download the file to make edits.
